# State of War: Remastered

Remaking an old game, _State of War_.

## Who are you?

We are a group of fans of a game named _State of War_, published by ~[Cypron-Studios](www.cypron-studios.com)~.

## What are you doing?

We are trying to remake this game into a better one.

## Why are you doing this?

State of War is a very impressive game. However, since it's developer had stopped technical support on
the game long ago, attempting to create community content for the game is extremely hard. By reverse
engineering game files, we are capable of creating custom map, terrian etc. But that is not enough, and
we seek a game with better support of community content.

Also, it contains some dreams the maintainer, Taxerap, had when he played this game when he was 8.

## How are you goint to do this?

Creating a game is not a trivial task. This is a complicated topic and will be fully explained through documents under the [docs](/docs) folder.

## When are you finishing this?

Probably before 2100.
