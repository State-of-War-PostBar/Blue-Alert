# Frequently asked questions

Questions that sometimes even I will question my self...

## Why not use some free and mature game engines or frameworks like Unreal, Unity or even WE, but "reinvent the wheel"?

Because I'm lazy.

## Why use the C language but not some language with some "avadvnreacued" features?

Because I'm lazy.

## Why not use mature libraries but keep writing your own code?

Because I'm lazy.

## WT*? How lazy are you???

I'm too lazy to reach Ctrl so I hand-typed the last tree sentences, provided the fact that I can still reach Shift.
