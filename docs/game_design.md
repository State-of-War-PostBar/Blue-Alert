# Game Design

## Principle

Ra2 (_Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2_, including its expansion _Yuri's Revenge_) is often looked as a conterpart of State of War. However, State of War is significantly less complex than ra2. Nevertheless, State of War must have its own fascination that attracts players, otherwise we would all go play ra2 instead. Simplicity and straight-forwarding of State of War should play a great role on that.  
When comparing State of War to ra2 (or RTSs like _Starcraft / Warcraft III_):

- Resources in the map are extremely limited
- Much more difficult to completely eradicate enemies from an area
- Much slower paced (unit production, technology, moving and attacking etc.)
- Less use of APM
- Defense side has more advantage than offensive side, contray to common games (varies by maps)

Such differences have made State of War unique from other games. Player can pay more attention to tactics and planning, rather than training APM crazily. And that is what I think makes State of War deserves great respect. Thus, State of War: Remastered shall not violate such principle.

~~tldr; you still can't build buildings~~

## Balance

However, we can all agree that balance in the original game design is extremely... weird. We will be balancing original capabilities of units and defenses to somehow make lit more balance. Additional contents for the remastered version should also be tested.
