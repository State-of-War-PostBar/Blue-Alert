# Game Design

## Principle

This game is primarily inspired by a game named _State of War (2001)_, an early RTS game made by ~~Cypron Studio~~ (now [Cypronia](https://cypronia.com)).  
Ra2 (_Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2_, including its expansion _Yuri's Revenge_) is often looked as a counterpart of State of War. However, State of War is significantly less complex than ra2. State of War has its own fascination that attracts players, otherwise we would all go play ra2 instead. Simplicity and straight-forwarding of State of War should play a great role on that.  
When comparing State of War to ra2 (or RTSs like _Starcraft / Warcraft III_):

- Resources in the map are extremely limited
- Much slower paced (unit production, technology, moving and attacking etc.)
- Less use of APM
- Defense side has more advantage than offensive side, contray to common games (varies by maps)

Such differences have made State of War unique from other games. Player can pay more attention to tactics and planning, rather than training APM crazily. And that is what I think makes State of War deserves great respect. Thus, Blue Alert shall not violate such principle.

~~tldr; you still can't build buildings~~

## Balance

However, we can all agree that balance in the original game design is extremely... weird. We will be trying our best to balance units.
