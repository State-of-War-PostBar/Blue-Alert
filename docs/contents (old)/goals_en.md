# New features for SoW

We have added and removed features for State of War...

## Quality of life changes
There will not be restriction of 22 levels. The original world map selection is kept, but we
also provide a better way to select custom levels.

Multiplayer games will allow at most **24** players on the same battlefield.

Built-in map editor that supports _hot edit_ (you can play the map when editing).

Allow multiple people to create map at the same time.

## Mechanics

**Aesearch Point**  
Short for _Advanced Research Points_.
A new type of resource, collected by a new building, Advanced Labratory.  
Used to do advanced upgrading, described later in the document.

**Tank Upgrade**  
Tank now have LV4 and LV5 upgrade.  
1 - 2 - 3 - 4 all require 500 research points to upgrade. For LV5, you need 500 research points and 100 aesearch points.  
There are two types of LV5 tanks upgradable that you need to select for each type of tank (named **A** and **B**).  
You cannot change the type after you upgrade to LV5. The selection will stick to the factory, even after it's captured.  
After the factory is captured, all LV4 and 5 units will be degraded to LV3.

**Walker Upgrade**  
Walkers (except for NAB) can be upgraded by using 600 research points and 120 Aesearch points.  
NAB can be upgraded by 700 research points and 150 arsearch points.  
See below for upgraded units.

## Edit to old buildings/units

**Heavy Factory**  
When heavy factory is destroyed, units that are upgraded to LV3 will be degraded to LV2 instead of 1.  
(If map creator did not change the initial level of the units)

**Technology**  
Technologies can now mix and match in the same tech building!

(This was a thank to one of the content creator, DragoonKiller)

**Laser Tower**  
Turret that requires 2000 gold. Can fire at multiple units in the same time, damage is slightly
higher than Rotary turret.  
Requires _Focusing Lens_ technology to build.

## Technologies
Technology will not just be icons for buildings. Every technology icon has its own meaning now.  
A building can simutenously have multiple technologies.

Only one orbital strike can be standby. (Second one will not produce until first one is used)  
Headquarters share the production progress. More headquarters -> faster production.

**Lightning Storm**  
**Nuclear Strike**  
Airforces produced by DragoonKiller's bases.  
I don't think they need any explanation...
